`FTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol>`_ is the standard network protocol that is used to transfer files from a server to a client. 
It is not considered a secure form of communication, since although it can be configured to use a username and password for each client, 
this is vulnerable to brute force dictionary and social engineering attacks.
