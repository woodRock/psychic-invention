Technology
==========

Here we provide an overview with code examples for the technologies used in the NZODN database. 
These examples cover the use cases encountered when ingesting data into the database. 
This section does not provide an exhaustive documentation of NZODN internals, only what the ingestor need worry about. 
Working examples, and links to further documentation, are provided for each technology to give a user intuition for how to use to ingest data.

..  These sections can get bulky, we seperate concerns by having an individual document for each technology in the `tech` folder.
    For ease of use, we organize the technologies in alphabetical order, and cross-reference where appropriate to avoid duplication.
