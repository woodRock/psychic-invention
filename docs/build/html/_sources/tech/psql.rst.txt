`PostgreSQL <https://postgresql.org/about/licence>`_ is a free and open-source relational database management software. 
We use the `Postgis <https://postgis.net/>`_ extension to add support for spatial data to Postgres. 
This extension follows the SQL specification from the `Open Geospatial Consortium <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium>`_. 
We use this table to store the geo-spatial data shown on the map and to store the file path and URL for the download data.
