`GeoServer <http://geoserver.org/>`_ is an open-source tool developed using Java. 
It provides a user interface to create web map services that connect to databases, with interoperability with PostgreSQL. 
It publishes data from any major spatial data source using open standards published by the Open Geospatial Consortium.
