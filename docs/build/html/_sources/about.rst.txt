Ingesting data into the New Zealand Ocean Data Network (aka. `NZODN <https://nzodn.nz/>`_).

The data comes from various proprietary instruments in the field. 
So there is little standard or consistency across the format that the data may come. 
This makes complete automation of the process difficult. 
However, new data that need to be ingested may have similar formats to existing data sets. 
We can glean inspiration for how to approach new datasets, from the existing datasets on the NZODN.

This project occurs on an ongoing basis, as a State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) and Research Company, `Niwa <https://niwa.co.nz/>`_ has an obligation to publish a certain quota of their research to the public. 
The process for doing so needs to be well documented and maintained, such that it can easily be replicated by others in the future.
